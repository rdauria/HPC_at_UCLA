# HPC_at_UCLA
A series of jupyter notebooks with introductory material to computing on the Hoffman2 Cluster.

The notebooks are meant to be seen in this order:

- INTRO_TO_H2C.ipynb
- Unix_shell_and_environmental_modules.ipynb
- Jupyter-on-H2C.ipynb
- Interactive_Computing_on_H2C.ipynb
- Batch_Jobs_on_H2C.ipynb

NOTE: Any notebook which contains cells with bash code, meant to be executed on the cluster, may not render correctly on GitHub. To visualize the notebook correctly:

      - execute  the notebook on the Hoffman2 Cluster itself (see instructions in Jupyter-on-H2C.ipynb)
      - visualize the notebook through NBviewer (https://nbviewer.org/) -- note: not all notebooks may work
      - notebooks with bash code also have companions text files that could be used to double check syntax  

**NOTE** to render the notebooks correctly navigate to: https://nbviewer.org/ and enter in the search bar the full address of a notebook (e.g., https://github.com/rdauria/HPC_AT_UCLA/blob/master/INTRO_TO_H2C.ipynb):
